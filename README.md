Just getting the hang of this here git hub thing... 

R, statistics and machine learning are the name of the game. But, seems like enough people are stomping around their keyboards laying out python libraries these days that I figure I ought to check it out.  Oh, and github seems like a good way to collaborate with others along the way. Vamos pra frente!
